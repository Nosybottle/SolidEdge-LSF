# SolidEdge - Least Squares Fitting

Allows user to select vertices and use them to construct various geometrical objects (plane, cylinder, ...).

<br></br>
To change language or cylinder search steps modify configuration file **_config/settings.ini_**

Currently supported languages: english, czech

Note: I am not a mathematician. I don't understand the math used for fitting various geometries, so there may be bugs or incorrect methods.
